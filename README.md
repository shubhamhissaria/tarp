tarp project
Aim: The aim is to make an android app that helps schedule meetings between teachers and students
The activities are:
1. Splash Screen: This basically acts as an introduction page with a wallpaper with the name of the app showing
2. Login: This activity is common for both teachers and students. It authenticates the user and based on the type of user (student/faculty) it redirects.
3. Faculty Signup: This activity is used to help new teachers join the app
4. Student Signup: This activity is used to help new students join the app
5. Find Faculty: When a student needs to find a faculty, he/she uses this to search for the teacher using the teacher's name
6. Landing: Simple landing page for the students after logging in
